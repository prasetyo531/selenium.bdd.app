GIVEN (describing the context)
WHEN (describing the action)
THEN (describing the outcome)
AND (further action/event)

--good grammar rule--
Given steps should use past or present-perfect tense, because they represent an initial state that must already be established.
When steps should use present tense, because they represent actions actively performed as part of the behavior.
Then steps should use present or future tense, because they represent what should happen after the behavior actions.
